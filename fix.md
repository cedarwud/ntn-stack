# NTN Stack Test Execution Issues and Fixes

## Test Execution Report
**Started**: 2025-06-25  
**Test Suite**: Reorganized comprehensive test suite  
**Location**: `/home/sat/ntn-stack/tests/reorganized/`

## Issues Found and Fixes Applied

### Issue #1: Missing Reports Directory ✅ FIXED
**Error**: Reports directory missing  
**Impact**: Environment verification fails  
**Fix**: Created complete reports directory structure:
- `/home/sat/ntn-stack/tests/reports/unit/`
- `/home/sat/ntn-stack/tests/reports/integration/`
- `/home/sat/ntn-stack/tests/reports/e2e/`
- `/home/sat/ntn-stack/tests/reports/performance/`
- `/home/sat/ntn-stack/tests/reports/coverage/`

### Issue #2: Missing API Clients Fixture ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `fixture 'api_clients' not found`  
**Impact**: API integration tests cannot run  
**Fix**: Changed fixture scope to `@pytest.fixture(scope="class")` in test_api_integration.py

### Issue #3: Async Tests Being Skipped ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `async def functions are not natively supported and have been skipped`  
**Impact**: All async tests are skipped (14 tests)  
**Fix**: Added `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators to all async test methods and simplified pytest.ini asyncio configuration

### Issue #4: Unknown Pytest Markers ✅ FIXED
**Warning**: Unknown pytest marks: api, health, backend, netstack  
**Impact**: Test categorization not working properly  
**Fix**: Added missing markers to pytest.ini configuration

### Issue #5: Test Class Collection Warning ✅ FIXED
**Warning**: TestAPIClient has __init__ constructor  
**Impact**: Utility class being treated as test class  
**Fix**: Renamed `TestAPIClient` to `BaseTestAPIClient` in shared/utils/test_client.py

### Issue #6: Service Availability in Test Environment ⚠️ EXPECTED
**Finding**: SimWorld backend returns 404 during health checks in test environment
**Impact**: Some integration tests fail due to services not running
**Status**: Expected behavior - not all services are running in the test environment

## Test Execution Results

### Basic Functionality Tests ✅ PASSING
- All 7 basic functionality tests pass
- Python environment: 3.11.12 ✅
- Project structure validation ✅ 
- Import validation ✅
- Test configuration ✅

### Async Integration Tests ✅ WORKING
- Async test execution now working properly
- Health monitoring tests functional
- Service connectivity validated:
  - NetStack API: HTTP 200 (healthy) ✅
  - SimWorld Frontend: HTTP 200 (healthy) ✅
  - SimWorld Backend: HTTP 404 (expected - service not running in test env) ⚠️

## Final Comprehensive Test Results
