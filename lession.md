# Introduction to LEO Satellite Networks
- Key Characteristics:
- Altitude: 500-2000 km
- Orbital Speed: ~7.5 km/s
- Coverage per Satellite: 2-4 minutes visibility
- Global Coverage: Mega-constellations (1000+ satellites)
- Major Challenges:
- Frequent Handovers: Every 5-6 seconds
- Dynamic Topology: Constantly changing network structure
- Propagation Delays: 1-4 ms one-way
- Doppler Effects: High frequency shifts
- Small Signal Variations: Similar RSRP at cell center and edge

# 3GPP Measurement Events for Handover Trigger
- Key Variables:
- D2 Event: Ml1 = distance from serving satellite, Ml2 = distance from neighbor satellite
- A4 Event: Mn = neighbor cell measurement (RSRP/RSRQ/RS-SINR)
- A5 Event: Mp = serving cell measurement, Mn = neighbor cell measurement
- LEO-Specific Advantages:
- D2 Event: Uses satellite ephemeris data and UE position for precise distance calculation
- A4 Performance: 30% better performance than A3 in LEO environments
- A5 Dual Threshold: Prevents ping-pong effects in weak signal areas

# Measurement Report-based Handover (Traditional Approaches)
- Standard Handover Procedure:
- 1. UE Measurements → Serving & neighbor satellites
- 2. Measurement Reports → Sent to serving gNB/satellite
- 3. Network Decision → Handover target selection
- 4. Handover Execution → Switch to target satellite
- Measurement-Based Challenges in LEO:
- - Doppler Shift: Rapid frequency changes affect measurements
- - Measurement Delays: 150-300ms propagation delays
- - Small Signal Difference: Similar RSRP between cell center and edge
