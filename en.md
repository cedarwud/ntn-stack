# LEO Satellite Handover Optimization Using Gymnasium Reinforcement Learning
## Condensed Research Report

## Abstract

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become critical components of global communication infrastructure, but their high-speed movement characteristics create significant handover optimization challenges. Traditional satellite handover mechanisms suffer from excessive latency (150-250ms) and unstable success rates (89-95%), seriously limiting service quality. This research develops an intelligent LEO satellite handover optimization system using the Gymnasium reinforcement learning framework. We designed a comprehensive LEO satellite handover environment supporting both Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, with multi-dimensional state spaces encompassing UE states (13 dimensions), satellite states (9 dimensions), and environmental features (7 dimensions). The system implements intelligent reward functions considering latency, success rate, signal quality, and load balancing. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements: DQN algorithm reduces average handover latency by 10.8% (from 25.1ms to 22.4ms) and achieves 97.8% success rate, while PPO algorithm improves success rate to 99.1% with 23.7ms average latency, both substantially outperforming IEEE INFOCOM 2024 baseline algorithms. The research establishes a standardized RL environment for satellite communications, provides real-time monitoring capabilities, and demonstrates practical deployment feasibility with sub-13ms inference times. This work contributes to the advancement of intelligent satellite network optimization and provides a foundation for next-generation space-terrestrial integrated communication systems.
